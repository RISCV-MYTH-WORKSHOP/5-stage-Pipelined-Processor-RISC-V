# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop - Designing a 5 stage Pipelined processor based on the RISC-V ISA using TL-Verilog

This repository contains my work during the 5 day workshop conducted by VSD Corp and Redwood EDA. 
We designed a processor that supports a subset of the RISC-V instruction set using TL-Verilog for RTL implementation. [Makerchip IDE](https://www.makerchip.com/) was used to simulate the TL-Verilog code.


Here is the processor I built
